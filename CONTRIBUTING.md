I'd love that you contribute to FireClip project and make it even better than it is!
I'd like you to follow these guidelines:

## <a name="hiw"></a> How it works?
FireClip is backed by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Realm](https://realm.io/).

FireClip uses Firebase's...

* Realtime database - Storing current clips and favourite clips.
* Firebase Auth - Providing Google Signin and Email signin for Authentication.
* Firebase storage - Sharing a file (limited size) across all of your devices.
* Firebase messaging - For push notification

Realm object database is a simple alternative to SQLite and Core Data.

## <a name="wim"></a> What is missing?
We know that FireClip is still in beta. FireClip is still missing its main features to be implemented.

* Encryption - Encrypt the clips while storing it to Firebase Database.
* File transfer - Upload the newly copied file to Firebase storage by replacing the old file.

## <a name="aof"></a> Add a feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lvabarajithan/FireClip-for-Android/). 

If you'd like to implement a new feature, conside whether it is:

* **Major change**: Discuss first on the issue tracker so that we can coordinate better together and prevent duplication of work. 
* **Small change**: It can be crafted and submited using Pull Request directly.

## <a name="iab"></a> Issues and bugs
If you find a bug in the source code or Documentation, you can submit an issue to this [Repository](https://github.com/lvabarajithan/FireClip-for-Android/).

Please also consider to [contact me]().

## <a name="cr"></a> Coding rules
